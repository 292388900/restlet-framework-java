---  Restlet changes log  ---
-----------------------------


0.15 beta
 - Added org.restlet.Chainlet interface and com.noelios.restlet.ChainletImpl
 - Factorize common code between MapletImpl and ChainletImpl into com.noelios.restlet.util.RestletTarget
 - Removed unused "parent" parameter for Maplet construction
 - Renamed UniformCall.userAgentName into clientName
 - Added UniformCall.clientAddress property to store the client's IP address
 - Updated the Jetty connectors to set the client IP address
 - Added Representation.getSize method
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.LoggerChainlet to log restlet calls.
 - Added com.noelios.restlet.util.LogFileHandler and com.noelios.restlet.util.LogFormatter support classes.
 - Added Zip, PDF, Word entries in org.restlet.data.MediaTypes enumeration.
 - Greatly improved the content negotiation algorithm to take into account language preferences.
 - Added lightweight string template engine at com.noelios.restlet.util.StringTemplate.
 

0.14 beta
 - Completed the tutorial
 - Added integration with Jetty 6.0.0 beta 5
 - Modified the build and packaging, especially for extensions
      - needed to support the two versions of Jetty adapter (5.1 and 6.0 beta)
      - allows ligth deployments of NRE (only one JAR file) 
 - do* methods in HttpClient now returns the created and handled call so status can be tested
 - Tutorial source code has been added (com.noelios.restlet.tutorial)
 - Added normalizePath to StringUtils issues with file separators different between Unix and Windows 
 - OriginServerImpl renamed ComponentImpl to follow the interfaces changes in 0.13beta
 - Fixed issue in getPath(index, strip) method of RestletCallImpl not passing on the index parameter (0 instead)
 

0.13 beta
 - Added a detailled tutorial (draft version)
 - Added doPut and doDelete methods to NRE HTTP client
 - Added MediaTypes.TEXT_PLAIN
 - Added code of tutorial examples in the com.noelios.restlet.test package
 - Implemented the getLastModificationDate() for FileRepresentation
 - Correctly sets the media type parameter passed to FileRepresentation
 - JettyConnection now sets the charset parameter for content-type headers, when a character set is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the ETag header when a tag is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the Expires header when an expiration date is defined
 - JettyConnection now sets the Last-Modified header when a modification date is defined
 - Added getMethods() method to org.restlet.Resource and FileResource, to return allowed methods
 - Added setResource() and getResource() to the Representation interface and AbstractRepresentation class
 - Moved connector handling methods from OriginServer to Component as other components (proxies, user agents, etc.) can have connectors attached to them


0.12 beta
 - Distribution license changed from GPL to CDDL (similar to Mozilla Public License).
 - Added createCharacterSet() to Factory interface, Manager and Engine classes.
 - HttpClient now correctly sets the output media type and character set when available.
 

0.11 beta
 - Renamed JettyConnector to JettyServer
 - Removed unnecessary HttpServer interface
 - Replaced many RestletException by IOException in non Restlet specific classes and interfaces
 - TemplateRepresentation no longer load the template upon creation as recommanded for performance reasons
 - Completed the separation between the Resltet API and the implementations: added org.restlet.Factory interface and org.restlet.Manager class.
 - Restlet API implementations must register their implementation of org.restlet.Factory with the org.restlet.Manager before usage.
 - Renamed CallImpl to UniformCallImpl
 - Added setter methods to UniformCall for request field (useful when preparing a call for a client connector)
 - Added org.restlet.component.DefaultRestletServer and DefaultRestletContainer for easy subclassing by developpers
 - Added client HTTP connector in NRE


0.10 beta
 - Renamed all Default* classes in com.noelios.restlet into *Impl for clarity purpose.
 - Added Status.getUri() method and improved Status.getDescription().
 - Removed the NONE values from Status and Method enumerations, null is doing a better job.
 - Added a DirectoryRestlet that behaves like a regular Web server. In addition, automatic media type, language and character set detection and setting is available in a way that hides technical names and extensions, allowing a clean content negotiation.
 - Fixed issue with character encoding in the TemplateRepresentation (FreeMarker integration).
 - Moved FileResource and FileRestlet to com.noelios.restlet
 - Refactored the Jetty HTTP server connector to bypass their HTTP handler layer. Now we directly work out of the Jetty SocketListener and HttpConnection class. This will improve performances and reduce the memory consumed. Note that version 5.1.5 of Jetty is required as it contains a necessary fix.
 - Moved classes in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jse into com.noelios.restlet (restlets, FileResource), com.noelios.restlet.data (representations and readers) or com.noelios.restlet.ext.jee (JDBC).
 - Refactored com.noelios.restelt.RestletMappings into com.noelios.MapletImpl and used it as a delegate in org.restlet.DefaultMaplet.
 - Added factory methods to the OriginServer and RestletContainer interface to let the developer override some default implementations and to prevent direct references to specific restlet API implementations.
 - Added proper getName() and getDescription() implementations to Method enums
 - Separated Method into Method, Methods and DefaultMethod to allow any method. Added getUri() method.
 - Separated CharacterSet into CharacterSet and CharacterSets.
 - Separated Language into Language and Languages.
 - Added all HTTP and WebDAV methods in Methods.
 - Separated Status into Status, Statuses and Default Status to allow any status. 
 - Variant interface was renamed RepresentationMetadata to remove ambiguity. Also added "expirationDate", "modificationDate" and "tag" properties.
 - Added Tag interface and TagImpl for cache validation purpose.
 - Instead of deriving Variant, Representation now has a getMetadata() method returning an instance of RepresentationMetadata.
 - Added all existing HTTP and WebDAV statuses in Statuses.
 - Added a setTemporaryRedirect() method to UniformCall.
 - Upgraded the JDBC Client to support multiple databases, drivers and connection pools.


0.9 beta
 - Moved com.restlet into com.noelios.restlet
 - Moved  net.restlet into org.restlet
 - Added a readParameter(String parameterName) method to Form and FormReader and their default implementations
 - Allowed multiple invocations of the DefaultForm.getFormReader() method when it is possible to reset the underlying input stream.
 - Added a logging in com.noelios.restlet.ext.jetty.RestletHandler using java.util.logging mechanism.
 - Refactored all code to use J2SE 5.0 language features (generics, enums)
 - Added Status and Method enumerations in org.restlet.data
 - Renamed Call to UniformCall
 - Added a RestletCall interface which extends UniformCall with a flexible way to get the path of each restlet in the stack of restlets that handled the call so far.
 - Added a org.restlet.data.Reference interface to work around the limitation of java.net.URI which is not a mutable class.
 - Moved Resource and Restlet interfaces at the root level (org.restlet). 
 - Refactored the UniformInterface. Many methods where moved to the Reference interface. Added “referrerURI” and “resourceURI” properties.
 - Separated the Restlet interface into Maplet and Restlet. Maplets are specialized restlets capable of delegating restlet calls to child restlets. RestletContainer now extends Maplet.
 - Renamed DefaultRestlet into AbstractRestlet.


0.8 beta
 - First public release
