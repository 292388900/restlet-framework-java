"Testing asynchronous systems is hard. Not only does it require handling 
threads, timeouts and concurrency issues, but the intent of the test code 
can be obscured by all these details. Awaitility is a DSL that allows you 
to express expectations of an asynchronous system in a concise and easy 
to read manner."
