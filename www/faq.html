<h3><a name="01">1. What are the advantages of using Restlets instead of Servlets?</a></h3>

<p>
   The main advantage is that Restlets strictly follow the REST architecture style as defined by Roy T. Fielding, author of the HTTP protocol. This ensures that your application can easily be developped in a RESTful manner. Each concept of REST has a corresponding Java interface or class in the Restlet API. Also, Restlet removed the concepts of in-memory sessions which are not RESTful and a major bottleneck for availability and scalability in Servlet applications.<br/>
   <br/>
   Another advantage is the ability to work with multiple protocols (HTTP, JDBC, SMTP, etc.) using the exact same API. This is true for both client-side
   and server-side application. Of course, a Restlet application can naturally worked as a client and a server at the same time. It's a truly Web centric
   framework. If you compare it to the Servlet API, it's an HTTP-only API with support for server-side code. To do client-side code, you need to rely on
   the low-level HttpURLConnection class from the JDK which uses a totally different API.<br/>
   <br/>
   Also, the Restlet API is cleanly separating the low-level protocol aspects from the application aspects. For most application, you won't need to
   access to HTTP headers to get the media type of a request, you just use call.getMetadata().getMediaType(). This separation enables the protocol connectors to implement any optimization they need without interferring with the application code. With Servlet, everything is mixed as application can directly modify the HTTP headers and have the control over the output stream.<br/>
   <br/>
   In addition, via the use of Maplets, the Restlet API gives full control of the call dispatching to developers. In the Servlet world, the standard approach is to configure the URI mappings in the configuration file of the container, which is not as flexible. There is always to possibility to manually handle the dispatching or to rely on third-party frameworks like Struts and Spring, but it's just not as convenient and powerful as the integrated support with Maplets.<br/>
   <br/>
   Finally, the Restlet API is IO agnostic as its core Representation interface can work equally well with BIO streams and NIO channels. This opens a
   great potential of performance when fully NIO compliant connectors will become available. The main advantage will be the increase scalability by removing
   the need to associate one thread for each opened connection which is a major bottleneck in Servlet containers.
</p>

<h3><a name="02">2. Can I run Restlets inside my Servlet container?</a></h3>

<p>
   Yes, even if this is not required. If you can't use the standalone HTTP connectors provided in the Noelios Restle Engine, you can use the ServerServlet
   connector which is an adapter between the Servlet API and the Restlet API. See the <a href="file:///d:/Restlet/www/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/ext/servlet/ServerServlet.html">
   ServerServlet Javadocs</a> for details on how to configure your Servlet container.
</p>

<h3><a name="03">3. Can the Restlets composing a site be defined in an XML file?</a></h3>

<p>
   The recommended way to configure Restlets is by using the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/build/package-summary.html">fluent builders</a>. There is a <a href="http://www.restlet.org/tutorial#part12">tutorial entry</a> illustrating this approach. The resulting Java code is both compact and self-describing, so using XML configurations isn't our top priority. Alternatively, A.J. Barnes has done some nice work to integrate Restlets with Spring autowiring service which is based on an XML configuration.
   You can find some details of this effort <a href="http://restlet.tigris.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=12">here</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="04">4. What JAR files must I have in my classpath for a minimal application?</a></h3>

<p>
   In a Restlet distribution, all JAR files are located under the "lib" directory. The <b>org.restlet.jar</b> file is containing the standard Restlet API.
   Even though you can compile your code with only this JAR file, is it very likely that you'll also want to use the additional features provided by the
   reference implementation (Noelios Restlet Engine or NRE). In any case, to run a minimal application, you'll also need the <b>com.noelios.restlet.jar</b>
   file containing the core of the NRE. This core JAR also contains the default HTTP client connector.
</p>

<h3><a name="05">5. What are the other JAR files for?</a></h3>

<p>
   Beside the client HTTP connector which is part of the core NRE JAR, you need to add to your classpath the JAR file of each additional connector that
   your application is using. If you want to act as an HTTP server, you can choose between three different connectors, two standalone based on Jetty 5
   or Jetty 6, and one embedded if you want to use an existing Servlet container like Tomcat.
</p>

<p>
   There are other optional extensions to the NRE, like SMTP and JDBC clients. Each one correspond to a seperate Java package under com.noelios.restlet.ext.*
   and is packaged as a separate JAR file available under on of the "lib" subdirectories. For example, if you need to send emails, you must include the
   following JAR files: /lib/javamail1.3/mail.jar (JavaMail) and /lib/javamail1.3/restlet.javamail.jar (NRE extension).
</p>

<p>
   No further configuration is needed as the NRE runtime will automatically detect the extensions present if the application classpath. That's why you
   can rely on the standard Restlet API to create connector, for example: new DefaultServer(Protocols.HTTP, "My server", handler, 8182).
</p>

<h3><a name="06">6. Why are there two Jetty versions provided?</a></h3>

<p>
   The Jetty 5 connector is based on the stable, production-proven Jetty 5.1 HTTP connector. It has full support for HTTPS and should be your default
   choice for most situations. The Jetty 6 connector is based on the next version of Jetty, currently under development. As this is a full rewrite of
   Jetty, it will have a longer release cycle. Currently, it doesn't support HTTPS but in the end, it is expected that the Jetty 5 connector will be
   removed in favor of a stable Jetty 6 one.
</p>

<h3><a name="07">7. How do I provide password protection on a server?</a></h3>

<p>
   Currently, the Noelios Restlet Engine supports Basic HTTP authentication via the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/GuardChainlet.html">GuardChainlet</a>.
   For details on how to use this Chainlet, please check the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/tutorial#part09">part 9 of the tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="08">8. How do I check the mime type of a document PUT on my server?</a></h3>

<p>
   This is simple: call.getInput().getMetadata().getMediaType() which returns an instance of the MediaType interface. From this instance you can get the
   main and sub types as well as the optional type parameters.
</p>

<h3><a name="09">9. How do I attach a status report to a client GET when the call fails on my server?</a></h3>

<p>
   This is also simple: call.setStatus(Statuses.CLIENT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND). Of course you have a complete list of options available in the Statuses
   enumeration, closely following the HTTP and WebDAV conventions. In addition, you can take advantage of the StatusChainlet in your application in
   order to return a description page to the client browser. Please check the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/tutorial#part08">part 8 of the tutorial</a>.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, a description can be added to the status report to help the client to understand the situation and correct its request if needed. For this
   purpose, you can use the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/data/DefaultStatus.html">DefaultStatus</a> class instead of the constants in Statuses. Just create new instances like this:
   call.setStatus(new DefaultStatus(Statuses.CLIENT_ERROR_NOT_FOUND, "Your comment goes here")).
</p>

<h3><a name="10">10. What about performance, are new Restlets created for each call received on my server?</a></h3>

<p>
   For a server connector such as Jetty HTTP, the main cost of Restlets resides in the creation of the Call (DefaultCall) object from the low-level
   HTTP request headers and body. This cost is very low and is optimized to only parse the required headers when the application actually needs the
   information when manipulating the Call object.
<p/>
<p>
   For the rest, the Restlet cost happens upon initialization or first call. By default, Restlet objects (including Chainlets and Maplets) are shared
   by all calls, unless you specify it otherwise. As calls are leaving in separate threads that can be concurrently handled by the Restlets, you need
   to be careful about using member variable to store temporary state. If at some point in your application, you need to have state that is specific
   to your call, you should use a special Restlet attachment mode on the parent Maplet or RestletContainer. For example, if you have a MyRestlet class
   that is stateful, you should attach it to the parent Maplet like this: parentMaplet.attach(MyRestlet.class). When the call thread will reach the
   parent Maplet and be routed to you MyRestlet, a new instance of this class will automatically be create before asking it to handle the call!
</p>

<h3><a name="11">11. How do I implement the traditional MVC pattern?</a></h3>

<p>
   Here is the basic proposition for implementing the MVC pattern with Restlets :
   <ol>
      <li>Model == (Resource + custom data). Use a stateful Restlet (with the class attachment to a Maplet) that also implements the Resource interface. The handle method should do a call.setBestOutput(this, ..) after the processing. You could also be very strict and fully separate the Resource from the processing Restlet.</li>
      <li>View == Representation. Create a Representation instance when the getRepresentation(variant) method is invoked on your Resource instance by the
      setBestOutput() method. It can be dynamic and based on the current state of your Resource (see FreeMarker TemplateRepresentation)</li>
      <li>Controller == (Maplets + Restlet). The hierarchy of Maplets leading to the actual service Restlet. The final Restlet can also be considered as part of the controller and could be fully separated from the Model as proposed above.</li>
   </ol>
</p>
<h3><a name="12">12 Any recommendations/guidelines in terms of how to deal with caching?</a></h3>

<p>
   Currently, client-side caching is supported via the "condition" property of Call. See the <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/data/ConditionData.html">
   ConditionData</a> interface for details. So, the first recommendation is to ensure that you correctly set all the representation metadata for
   your own representations (modification date, expiration date, tag). That will ensure that the server-side negotiation logic (used via the
   Call.setBestOutput() method) works optimally.
</p>
<p>
   Then, writing a generic server-side cache is a different story. The recommendation would be to follow the REST and HTTP specifications spirit as
   closely as possible. The only provision in the Restlet API is the org.restlet.connector.Cache interface which currently has no implementation.
<p/>
   For full-featured caching, you should look at popular projects like Squid: http://www.squid-cache.org/ or Apache caching modules. These caches can
   be installed transparently for the clients, as reverse proxies.
</p>

<h3><a name="13">13. What is the performance of the HTTP connectors?</a></h3>

<p>
   Note that, used as a server, the performance will depend on the actual
   connector used (HTTP, HTTPS, AJP, Servlet adapter, etc.). So what would be
   needed is a set of tests comparing the different options. Also, the results
   will vary between the Jetty 5.1 connectors and the Jetty 6.0 one. For the
   Servlet adapter the performance will vary with the actual Servlet container
used and how it is configured.
</p>

<h3><a name="14">14. Why is my HTTP client sending unwanted "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type headers?</a></h3>

<p>
   When you do a simple GET with the Restlet HTTP client connector, it appears that an extra "content-type" header is sent to the server, even though
   your call doesn't provide any input content (because you just GET a representation). This is due to a bug in the underlying JDK's HttpURLConnection
   class in JDK 5.0. This was fixed in recent JDK 6.0 builds as indicated in the <a href="http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6369510">bug report</a>.
</p>

<h3><a name="15">15. Can a Chainlet modify the call like a Servlet Filter?</a></h3>

<p>
   Absolutely! What the tutorial says is that only the requested "URI" shouldn't be modified. Beside the URI, anything else in the call object can
   be modified, before or after the delegation of the call to the attached Restlet.
</p>

<h3><a name="16">16. My server is running behind a proxy, can I get the actual client IP address?</a></h3>

<p>
   The immediate client IP address available is the only that is always available because its based on the underlying protocol connection.
   In HTTP, certain proxies do transfer the original client IP address (or addresses) by using some extra HTTP headers like "X-Forwarded-for". In the recent Restlet
   versions you can get all this information in a straightforward way. On the Call interface, you have two related methods <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/Call.html#getClientAddress()">getClientAddress()</a> and
   <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/Call.html#getClientAddresses()">getClientAddresses()</a>. Please check the Javadocs for details as there are some security risks in using the second method, especially if you are not
   controlling the intermediary proxies.
</p>

<h3><a name="17">17. Restlet calls abstract HTTP requests and responses, but can I get the low-level headers if I really need to?</a></h3>

<p>
   Yes, this is a request that we had several times. The common situation is where some custom or non-standard headers are used and need to be accessed.
   You access to the low-level call using: <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/api/org/restlet/Call.html#getConnectorCall()">Call.getConnectorCall()</a> then you have access to modified request and response header lists.
</p>

<h3><a name="18">18. Is there a mechanism to pass data sets to downstream Restlets?</a></h3>

<p>
   Yes, there are multiple mechanisms available. First, if you need to pass data related to the current authenticated user, such as its login name, password and role, you can simply use the related properties on the SecurityData interface accessible from the Call.getSecurity() method. If you need to store state, without any validation logic or behavior, you can use the Call.getAttributes() method which returns a modifiable map object.
</p>
<p>
   Finally, you can use the decorator pattern by wrapping the Call object into a larger one containing the extra properties and methods that you need. For this purpose, you just have to create a subclass of org.restlet.WrapperCall. Then, in one of your handle methods, you can simply wrap the current call instance. Unless you use a common base Restlet you will need to properly cast the call instance in subsequent Restlets in order to access to your wrapper methods.
</p>

<h3><a name="19">19. What is the difference between a Chainlet and a Maplet?</a></h3>

<p>
   On one hand, Chainlets are like filters that do some processing between two and only two other Restlets. They are useful for actions like logging, caching, compressing or security checks. On the other hand, the purpose of Maplets is to delegate or dispatch calls based on the internal URI patterns of your application. Maplets can map calls to one or more child Restlets. When the call is mapped to a child Restlet, the context path is advanced and the context matches are updated before actually delegating the call. See also, <a href="#01">this FAQ entry</a> for a comparison of Maplets with the Servlet API.

<h3><a name="21">21. How can I send and receive files with Restlets?</a></h3>

<p>
   To receive large files, from browsers for example, you can rely on the Apache FileUpload project which was integrated as an <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/ext/fileupload/package-summary.html">extension to NRE</a>. To send a file using the HTTP client connector, just create a new <a href="http://www.restlet.org/docs/nre/com/noelios/restlet/data/FileRepresentation.html">FileRepresentation</a> and set is as the input of your call.
