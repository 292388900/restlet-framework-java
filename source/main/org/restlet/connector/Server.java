/**
 * Connector that listens for connections and responds to requests.<br/><br/> "The primary connector types
 * are client and server. The essential difference between the two is that a client initiates communication by
 * making a request, whereas a server listens for connections and responds to requests in order to supply
 * access to its services. A component may include both client and server connectors." Roy T. Fielding
