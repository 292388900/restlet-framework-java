 * Abstract mechanism that enables communication between components.<br/><br/> "A connector is an abstract
 * mechanism that mediates communication, coordination, or cooperation among components. Connectors enable
 * communication between components by transferring data elements from one interface to another without
 * changing the data." Roy T. Fielding </br> "Encapsulate the activities of accessing resources and
 * transferring resource representations. The connectors present an abstract interface for component
 * communication, enhancing simplicity by providing a clean separation of concerns and hiding the underlying
 * implementation of resources and communication mechanisms" Roy T. Fielding
