The hamcrest library
--------------------

"The hamcrest project provides a library of matcher objects (also known as 
constraints or predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined 
declaratively, to be used in other frameworks. Typical scenarios include 
testing frameworks, mocking libraries and UI validation rules."
