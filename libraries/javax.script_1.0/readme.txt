The javax.script API
--------------------

"The JavaTM Scripting API is a scripting language independent framework for 
using script engines from Java code. With the Java Scripting API, it is 
possible to write customizable/extendable applications in the Java language and 
leave the customization scripting language choice to the end user. The Java 
application developer need not choose the extension language during 
development. If you write your application with JSR-223 API, then your users 
can use any JSR-223 compliant scripting language."
