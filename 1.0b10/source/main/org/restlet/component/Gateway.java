 * Intermediary component providing transparent encapsulation of other services. "A gateway
 * (a.k.a., reverse proxy) component is an intermediary imposed by the network or origin server to provide an
 * interface encapsulation of other services, for data translation, performance enhancement, or security
 * enforcement. Note that the difference between a proxy and a gateway is that a client determines when it
 * will use a proxy." Roy T. Fielding
