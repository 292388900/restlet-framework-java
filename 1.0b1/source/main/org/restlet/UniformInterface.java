/**
 * Uniform interface between all architecture components.<br/><br/> "The central feature that distinguishes
 * the REST architectural style from other network-based styles is its emphasis on a uniform interface between
 * components. By applying the software engineering principle of generality to the component interface, the
 * overall system architecture is simplified and the visibility of interactions is improved. Implementations
 * are decoupled from the services they provide, which encourages independent evolvability." Roy T. Fielding
