[Bugs fixed]
 - Overridden the StringRepresentation#setCharacterSet method, in order to refresh the 
   size of the representation. Reported by Calvin Cheng.
 - Fixed issue in the selection of connectors. The last connector in the classpath for
   a given protocol was selected instead of the first one, leading to counter-intuitive 
   behavior when multiple connectors were present in the classpath.
 - Fixed bug in DomRepresentation causing the loss of both public and system DocTypes. 
   Reported by Lee Saferite.
 - Fixed path error in test cases  module. Reported by Sean Landis, contributed by Alex Milowski.

[Enhancements] 
 - Added a getApplication() method to Context and Resource classes.
 - Added a new Grizzly based HTTP server connector (full NIO). Optmizations and support
   contributed by Jean-François Arcand.
 - Upgraded Apache MINA to version 1.1.0.
 - There are now default internal HTTP client and server connectors exposed in the NRE core.
   If no other HTTP connectors are found in the classpath, those connectors will be used.
   They should perform reasonably under normal workloads but won't be as scalable as the
   NIO based connectors such as Grizzly and MINA based ones. You don't have anything to do
   to configure them, just put the com.noelios.restlet.jar in your classpath along with the
   Restlet API's JAR. Note that they don't support HTTPS and persistent connections.
 - All HTTPS server connectors (Grizzly, Jetty and Simple) now have two configuration
   parameters to indicates whether a client authentication is wanted or required.
   Suggested by Toby Thain and Chuck Hinson.
 - A request attribute "org.restlet.https.clientCertificates" containing the list of SSL
   session certificates (if available and accessible) is now available. Currently, only
   the Simple connector is capable or setting it. Suggested by Toby Thain.
 - Simple connector now initialize a trust manager.
 - Added abstract CharacterRepresentation for representations based on character streams.
 - Added ReaderRepresentation for representations based on characters Readers.
 - Added WriterRepresentation for representations based on characters Writers.
 - Added ByteUtils.toString(Reader) method and refactored ByteUtils.toString(InputStream)
   to reuse it.
 - Added ByteUtils.getReader(InputStream, CharacterSet) method.
 - Added getReader() and a write(Writer) methods on Representation class.
 - Exposed the "file" property on the FileRepresentation class.
 - Added two new FreeMarker's TemplateRepresentation constructor to allow more ways to
   provide the template (via a representation or directly as a FreeMarker Template object).
 - Added W3C XML Schema and Relax NG media types.
 - Added validate() methods on XmlRepresentation to validate an XML representation against
   a given schema.
 - Added a getSource() method on XmlRepresentation that results a JAXP Source instance.
 - Added JAXB extension based on a contribution by Overstock.com (via Sean Landis).
 - Added JAXB 2.0 and StAX 1.0 libraries.
 - Added a Template.getVariableNames() method. Suggested by Stian Soiland.
 - Added new Dimension.AUTHORIZATION enum entry. Suggested by Stian Soiland.
 - The ServletConverter now also copy the Servlet's request attributes into the Restlet
   attributes map. Suggested by Leigh Klotz.
 - Added new media types for RSS and WADL. Contributed by Avi Flax.
 - Added Atom, Relax NG, RSS, RTF, WADL and XSD in the common extensions of MetadataService.
   Contributed by Avi Flax.
 - Simplified the management of MediaType constants. Contributed by Stian Soiland.
 - Added a Representation.release() to have an uniform way to release a representation without forcing
   a read for example or manually closing the socket, the channel, the file, etc.
 - Added a Message.release() method to have an easy way to release the message's entity. Suggested
   by Stian Soiland.
 - Application is now concrete and has a setRoot() method.
 - Added Component.setDefaultHost() method.
 - Moved the "expirationDate", "modificationDate", "tag", "size" properties from Variant to 
   Representation. The old properties are only deprecated for now but will be removed in a later version. 
 - Added SpringApplication, SpringComponent, SpringHost, SpringRouter, SpringServer to the 
   Spring extension to facilitate the wiring by Spring IoC.
 - The Resource class now accepts POST requests without any entity, or with an
   empty entity. Suggested by Sean Landis and Stian Soiland.
 - Added setters and getters for all the properties of all the classes in the API, including 
   the collection properties. Clarified the Javadocs for the default collection creations.
   This will greatly facilitate the usage of the API in IoC containers like Spring.
 - Renamed "URIResolver" property to "uriResolver" in TransformRepresentation.
 - Renamed "*Attribute" properties to "*Parameter" in TunnelService.
 - If Resource.getRepresentation(Variant) returns 'null', the Resource.handleGet() method now
   returns a NOT_FOUND (404) status. Suggested by John D. Mitchell. 
 - Added WADL extension with a WadlComponent capable of automatically wiring a Restlet component,
   application and resource classes. Suggested by Avi Flax. 
 - Added a createComponent() method on ServerServlet to facilitate the customization of the 
   component for a Servlet.
 - Updated the JaxbRepresentation#getObject so that JaxbException are not swallowed. Reported and contributed 
   by Sean Landis.
 - The Message's getEntityAsDom(), getEntityAsSax() and getEntityAsForm() are now caching the result
   representation for easier reuse in a Restlet filters chain. Suggested by Rob Heittman.
 - Finder.createResource() method now rethrows the Error exceptions thrown by Resource constructors.
   Suggested by Vincent Lari.
 - Added "accessRestricted" property to CookieSetting, currently mapped to the "httpOnly" Cookie attribute
   supported by recent browsers to prevent XSS attacks. Contributed by Rob Heittman.
 - Added logger-less constructors to Template. Suggested by Justin Makeig.
 - A custom classloader can now be specified when using the CLAP URIs. Just set the attribute
   "org.restlet.clap.classloader" on your Request instances with your classloader instance. This will
   be automatically be picked up by the CLAP connector. Reported by Alex Milowski.
 - Guard.secrets is now a final ConcurrentMap instead of just a Map instance. Suggested by Tim Peierls. 
 - Renamed Context's "dispatcher" property into "clientDispatcher" to distinguish with the new 
   "serverDispatcher" property. The "serverDispatcher" property allows the developer to optimize the
   sending of request to applications under the current component/JVM, as if they were dispatched by one
   of the server connectors. Suggested by Rob Heittman with feed-back from Marc Portier.
 - Split the Resource class to separate a new org.restlet.Handler class exposing the lower-level API,
   from the higher-level API of Resource. 
 - Added "available", "modifiable" and "readable" properties to the Resource class.
 - Added "rechallengeEnabled" property to Guard (true by default) to repeatedly challenge the client upon 
   reception of invalid credentials instead of forbidding the access like before. This conforms more 
   closely to the HTTP 1.1 specifications while leaving the door open for the stricter behavior. 
   Reported by Stephan Koops.
 - Refactored the implementation of dispatchers to derive from a base TemplateDispatcher class.
 - Added the "internalRouter" property to Component to attach internal/private Restlets, accessible via 
   the built-in RIAP client (Restlet Internal Access Protocol). Suggested by Marc Portier.
 - Updated the Protocol and LocalReference classes with support for the new RIAP scheme.

[Misc]
 - Removed AsyncWeb connector, to be replaced by a custom MINA based one.
 - Removed Jetty 5 connector from the code base. Jetty 6 connector is stable enough now.
 - Added Response.locationRef property as a replacement for the Response.redirectRef
   property that is now deprecated. Suggested by Michael Vogel and Avi Flax.
 - Updated projects to Eclipse 3.3. Minor adjustments required.
 - The ConverterService and all related methods on Message are deprecated, with no replacement as it 
   doesn't fit well with content negotiation. Most users prefer to handle those conversion in Resource
   subclasses. Suggested by Justin Makeig, Rob Heittman, Sumit Lohia.
