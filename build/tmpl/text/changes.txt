===========

- @version-full@ (@release-date@)
    - API changes
      - Removed deprecated classes and code.
      - The Route class has been reintroduced with a lighter
        behavior not depending on URI templates.
      - Added an UniformResource#setApplication() setter to be able
        to explicitly set the parent application used to pick up the
        ConverterService or MetadataService. This property is also 
        carried on by the copy constructor. Suggested by John Logdson.
      - Added UniformResource#toString() for easier debugging.
      - Added Representation#isSelectable() and getRegistration() method
        to manipulate the registration of the NIO channel with its 
        associated selector and received asynchronous notifications
        of available content.
      - Deprecated Application#setClientRoot, renamed into a 
        setOutboundRoot method.
    - Enhancements
      - Improved the naming of files created by the FILE local 
        connector so that media type extension comes at the end.
      - Added a fully new non-blocking NIO/HTTP connector in the engine, 
        in replacement of the previous one based on blocking BIO. 
        It has much better performance (latency, throughput and 
        scalability) and supports persistent connections and chunked
        encoding.
    - Bugs fixed
      - 
    - Misc
