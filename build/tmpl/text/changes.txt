- @version-full@ (@release-date@)
    - Enhancements
       - Upgraded Servlet API to version 3.0.1.
       - Updated Simple HTTP server library to version 5.0.4.
       - Added a JSONP filter that can automatically wrap JSON representations.
         Contributed by Mark Kharitonov and Cyril Lakech.
    - API changes
       - Refactored the OAuth extension to prevent the 
         org.restlet.ext.oauth.security subpackage.
       - Refactored the JacksonRepresentation to merge the 
         JacksonSmileRepresentation back into the 
         JacksonRepresentation. Also improved extensibility
         and default behavior of the CSV serialization format.
       - Added Request/Response.flushBuffers() method to attempt
         to force network buffers to be flushed out.
         Suggested by Yan Pujante.
       - Removed all code deprecated in branch 2.1.
       - Added patch-related methods to the ConverterService:
         applyPatch(Representation original, Representation patch) : Representation
         revertPatch(Representation modified, Representation patch) : Representation
         createPatch(Representation original, Representation modified) : Representation
       - Added patch(..) methods to ClientResource. Suggested by Brian Sletten.
       - Added patch(..) to ServerResource relying by default on the 
         ConverterService and on the put(..) methods. Suggested by Brian Sletten.
       - Added ClientInfo.acceptedPatches property and HTTP header writing/reading
         logic for "Accept-Patch".
       - Added IOException declaration to all the ConverterService methods.
       - Restored Role.equals(..) and hashCode(..) methods so that two roles with the
         same parent application, name and child roles are equals.
       - Added Role.application property to make it more explicit what is required
         for role equality and to make the MemoryRealm class less ambiguous.
         Reported by Tim Peierls, Martin Svensson, Peter Ansell and others.
       - Deprecated Role.ALL constant which wasn't compatible with the fact that 
         roles have specific applications as parent.
       - Deprecated constructors Role(String) and Role(String, String) and added 
         Role(Application, String) and Role(Application, String, String) as 
         replacements, using Application.getCurrent() to workaround the lack of 
         Application parameter in deprecated constructors.
    - Bug fixed
       - The same ones as in version 2.1.2.
    - Misc
       - Updated the links to the user guide in the wiki.

       - Of course, Maven is still supported via our Maven repository,
         the previous change is only for Restlet committers.
