          packages.
        - The com.noelios.restlet.ext.spring extension has been merged

          Contributed by Kevin Conaway.
    - API changes
        - A response with a 200 (Ok) status should have an entity. Now,

          Reported by Rob Heittman.
        - Removed all code deprecated in the Restlet 1.1 release.
        - Added org.restlet.data.Literal to represent RDF
          literals with an optional datatype. 
        - Added org.restlet.data.Link to represent RDF links (aka 
          triples, statements or relationships).
        - Moved o.r.u.Helper class, used privately by API classes to 
          the o.r.engine package.
        - Added MediaType constants APPLICATION_RDF_TRIG, 
          APPLICATION_RDF_TRIX, APPLICATION_RDF_TURTLE, 
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_XML and
          APPLICATION_SPARQL_RESULTS_JSON for RDF and SPARQL.
        - Added LinkReference and LinkSet classes to support RDF 
          reference manipulation (blank nodes for example) and RDF 
          graphs or models.
        - Added CharacterSet#DEFAULT constant, new constructor for 
          Charset instances and a toCharset() method. Suggested by
          Charles Gay.
        - Added Reference#toUri(), toUrl() and constructors from 
          java.net.URI and URL instances. Suggested by Cliff Binstock.
        - Added APPLICATION_ATOM media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_ATOM_XML.          
        - Added APPLICATION_ATOM_SERVICE_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_ATOMPUB_SERVICE.
        - Added APPLICATION_ATOMPUB_CATEGORY media type constant.
        - Added APPLICATION_KML and APPLICATION_KMZ media type 
          constants. Suggested by Frank Hellwig.          
        - Added APPLICATION_MATHML_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_MATHML.
        - Added APPLICATION_RSS_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_RSS.
        - Added APPLICATION_W3C_SCHEMA_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_W3C_SCHEMA.
        - Added APPLICATION_WADL_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_WADL.
        - Added APPLICATION_XHTML_XML media type constant and 
          deprecated APPLICATION_XHTML.
        - MediaType constructor now normalizes the main and sub parts.
          If invalid characters are detected, an IllegalArgumentExcept
          is thrown. Spaces are also trimmed and empty parts are 
          converted to '*'. Contributed by Nicolas Rinaudo.
        - Method#setUri() has been deprecated as Method instances 
          shouldn't be modifiable.          
     - Misc
        - JAX-RS extension:
            - added class ExendedUriBuilder with "file" extensions for
              content negotiation and an ExtendedUriInfo to get it.
            - Supports per-request-providers now.
            - JaxRsApplication will not clear the MetadataService (as
              before; was required to not use other extensions as given
              in the JAX-RS ApplicationConfig class).
        - The Directory class doesn't override the findTarget() method
          but uses the defaut Finder mechanism based on the 
          "targetClass" property. Therefore, it is easier to specify a
          subclass of org.restlet.engine.local.DirectoryResource in
          order to customize the default behavior. 
          Suggested by Cliff Binstock.
        - Upgraded db4o to version 7.7.67.
		  - Upgraded Grizzly to version 1.9.0.
		- Refactored engine support for the StatusService. Removed
		  ApplicationStatusFilter and ComponentStatusFilter.
		- Extracted all internal classes of ByteUtils into the new
		  org.restlet.engine.io package for easier reuse and 
		  maintenance.
		- Clarified Javadocs in Reference#getPath() methods.
        - Fixed potential NPE in Reference#decode() method.
        - Clarified Javadocs in FileRepresentation and methods 
          Representation#getDownloadName(), setDownloadName() in order
          to explain that setDownloadable(true) must be called first.
          Issue reported by Kevin Conaway.
        - The internal HTTP client doesn't send absolute request URIs
          anymore. It now sends them as relative URIs according to the
          HTTP 1.1 specification. Reported by Jonas Maturana Larsen.
