[Bugs fixed]
 - Overrided the StringRepresentation#setCharacterSet method, in order to refresh the 
   size of the representation. Reported by Calvin Cheng.
 - Fixed issue in the selection of connectors. The last connector in the classpath for
   a given protocol was selected instead of the first one, leading to counter-intuitive 
   behavior when multiple connectors were present in the classpath.
-  Fixed bug in DomRepresentation causing the loss of both public and system DocTypes. 
   Reported by Lee Saferite.

[Enhancements] 
 - Added a getApplication() method to Context and Resource classes.
 - Added a new Grizzly based HTTP server connector (full NIO). Optmizations and support
   contributed by Jean-François Arcand.
 - Upgraded Apache MINA to version 1.1.0.
 - There are now default internal HTTP client and server connectors exposed in the NRE core.
   If no other HTTP connectors are found in the classpath, those connectors will be used.
   They should perform reasonably under normal workloads but won't be as scalable as the
   NIO based connectors such as Grizzly and MINA based ones. You don't have anything to do
   to configure them, just put the com.noelios.restlet.jar in your classpath along with the
   Restlet API's JAR. Note that they don't support HTTPS and persistent connections.
 - All HTTPS server connectors (Grizzly, Jetty and Simple) now have two configuration
   parameters to indicates whether a client authentication is wanted or required.
   Suggested by Toby Thain and Chuck Hinson.
 - A request attribute "org.restlet.https.clientCertificates" containing the list of SSL
   session certificates (if available and accessible) is now available. Currently, only
   the Simple connector is capable or setting it. Suggested by Toby Thain.
 - Simple connector now initialize a trust manager.
 - Added abstract CharacterRepresentation for representations based on character streams.
 - Added ReaderRepresentation for representations based on characters Readers.
 - Added WriterRepresentation for representations based on characters Writers.
 - Added ByteUtils.toString(Reader) method and refactored ByteUtils.toString(InputStream)
   to reuse it.
 - Added ByteUtils.getReader(InputStream, CharacterSet) method.
 - Added getReader() and a write(Writer) methods on Representation class.
 - Exposed the "file" property on the FileRepresentation class.
 - Added two new FreeMarker's TemplateRepresentation constructor to allow more ways to
   provide the template (via a representation or directly as a FreeMarker Template object).
 - Added W3C XML Schema and Relax NG media types.
 - Added validate() methods on XmlRepresentation to validate an XML representation against
   a given schema.
 - Added a getSource() method on XmlRepresentation that results a JAXP Source instance.
 - Added JAXB extension based on a contribution by Overstock.com (via Sean Landis).
 - Added JAXB 2.0 and StAX 1.0 libraries.
 
[Misc]
 - Removed AsyncWeb connector, to be replaced by a custom MINA based one.
 - Removed Jetty 5 connector from the code base. Jetty 6 connector is stable enough now.
