- @version-full@ (@release-date@)
    - API changes
      - Moved SslContextFactory and DefaultSslContextFactory classes from 
        internal to public org.restlet.ext.ssl package.
      - Renamed Status#getName() method to getReasonPhrase() for more clarity
        regarding the purpose of the additional "description" property used
        for lengthier explanations.
      - Added Response#isFinal() and isProvisional() methods, based on
        Status#isInformational().
    - Enhancements
      - Updated and consolidated the SSL/HTTPS configuration parameters
        for all HTTPS connectors.
      - Added a warning message to indicate that an application without a 
        parent component can't handle outbound calls by default.
        Reported by John Logdson and Kristoffer Gronowski.
      - Allowed change of the parent context of a VirtualHost via the
        setContext() method.
    - Bug fixed
      - Fixed compatibility issue with GWT 2.3.
      - Fixed potential NPE in Restlet class when no context is available.
      - Fixed potential NPE in LogFilter. Reported by Aaron Summers.
      - Fixed parsing of HTTP requests with internal connector when the
        Host header was missing. Now falling back to IP address.
        Reported by Aaron Summers.
      - Fixed misleading log message when response are manually ranged
        (206 status and entity with range set). Reported by John Logsdon.
      - Fixed issue causing blocking of internal HTTP/SIP connector when 
        the entity was coming from Apache HTTP client.
      - Fixed issue causing potential loop in internal HTTP/SIP client
        when the response entity wasn't being consumed immediately.
      - Fixed issue causing potential IndexOutOfBounds exceptions.
      - The internal server (HTTP and SIP) now automatically exhausts the 
        request entity if it hasn't been consumed after the writing of the 
        final response.
      - The internal connector now calls back the ConnectorService methods.
      - The internal server now calls back Representation#release() method
        after sending an entity.
     - Misc
      - Updated Jetty to version 7.4.2.
      - Added awaitility and hamcrest libraries required by the oauth 
        extension.

- 2.1 Milestone 4 (04/27/2011)
    - API changes
      - Added protected redirect(...) and retry(...) methods on on ClientResource
        to facilitate extension of default behavior such as passing on cookies.
        Suggested by Martin Svensson.
      - ClientResource#entityBuffering now buffers non transient representations of
        unknown size. Necessary for GAE chunked issue.
      - Added Server#getActualPort() to return either the value of getPort()
        or getEphemeralPort() is the listening port is '0'.
      - Message#attributes is now a ConcurrentMap instead of a Map.
        Suggested by Tal Liron.
      - ClientResource now respects any change to the clientInfo preferences
        when using dynamic proxies (via wrap() for example). It only overwrites
        them if the default preferences state (empty lists) is found at invocation
        time. Suggested by Christoph Dietze.
      - The visibility of several methods on UniformResource and ClientResource
        has been changed to public.
      - Added Protocol#SDC and ChallengeScheme#SDC constants for the 
        Secure Data Connector protocol.
    - Enhancements
      - Added new HTTPS client connector based on the internal non-blocking NIO
        connector. Co-developped with NetDev.
      - The SDC protocol to connect to intranets from the cloud is now also 
        supported on the GAE edition via the org.restlet.ext.net extension. It 
        automatically sets the "use_intranet" HTTP header and increases the
        portability of your code between Restlet/GAE and other Restlet editions. 
        As SDC is natively supported on GAE, it doesn't require the 
        org.restlet.ext.sdc extension.
      - Added a new GAE extension for the GAE edition. It provides a dedicated
        authenticator based on the GAE UserService feature.
        Contributed by Matt Kennedy.
    - Bug fixed
      - Throwing a ResourceException with a given status, was resulting in
        500 status being returned to the client instead of the given status.
        Reported by Avi Flax and Rhett Sutphin.
      - Fixed bug with unlimited IO timeouts in internal HTTP connector.
        Reported by Michael Guiral.
    - Misc
      - The simplified logging formatter (one line) is now available only in
        the Java SE edition as it could cause troubles with Java EE container
        and potentially GAE/Android as we reconfigure the default log manager
        programmatically. Reported by Kristoffer Gronowski and Bo Xing.
      - Moved all SSL dependencies from the engine into the "org.restlet.ext.ssl"
        extension, forcing it as a new extension for several other ones such as
        Jetty, Apache HTTP Client or Simple. This extension takes more importance
        as it also contains the new scalable HTTPS/NIO internal connector just
        added. Please ensure that your classpath is adjusted. This also helps
        keeping core org.restlet.jar size small.

- 2.1 Milestone 3 (03/31/2011)
    - Breaking changes
      - The new support of GWT 2.2 is not backward compatible with applications 
        based on previous versions of GWT.
    - API changes
      - Deprecated the Client#connectTimeout property as it is hard to find
        compared to other connector parameters. Also, it isn't available for
        all connectors so it can be confusing to expose it.
        Use the "socketConnectTimeoutMs" connector parameter instead or
        the "maxIoIdleTimeMs" parameter for internal NIO connectors.
      - Deprecated the Engine#setInstance() method to favor the 
        Engine#register() ones which wrap logging initialization logic
        and added an Engine#clear() method to discard it altogether.
      - Added an getResponseLogMessage(request, response, duration) method to 
        LogService class so it can be easily overridden/customized. Also
        added a protected getDefaultResponseLogMessage(..) method returning the
        default IIS log message.
      - Added Representation#setReadListener() method to facilitate the setting
        of listeners interested in new content available for reading for 
        selectable representations.
      - Added higher level NIO event listeners in org.restlet.util package:
        InputListener, ReaderListener and StringListener.
      - Created a com.google.gwt.server library dedicated to the 
        org.restlet.gwt extension. This library will be shipped with the 
        JSE, JEE, GAE editions.
      - Added Message#onError callback invoked by the internal connector.
        Especially useful to detect if an outbound response failed to be
        written at the connector level.
      - Deprecated TunnelService#setHeaderTunnel() in favor of the new
        setHeadersTunnel() method.
      - Fixed default value of "maxQueued" for the internal connector to ensure
        threads are properly created up the the "maxThreads" value entered.
        Reported by Kristoffer Gronowski
      - Added new Series#getValuesArray(...) method variants.
      - Added ClientResource#maxRedirects property to prevent infinite 
        redirects, in addition to the existing infinite loop detection.
        Suggested by Henry Story.
      - Added ClientResource#requestEntityBuffering, responseEntityBuffering
        Boolean properties and setEntityBuffering(boolean) method in order to
        make transient entities reusable (retry attempts, chunk encoding issues
        with GAE, response entity reuse).
    - Enhancements
      - Keep alive empty lines between messages in a persistent connections are
        now eat silently. Reported by John Logsdon.
      - Refactored the internal NIO connector to better support the differences
        between HTTP and SIP protocols regarding transaction management.
      - Added a new SDC extension providing a client connector for the 
        Google Secure Data Connector protocol compatible with the official SDC 
        agent.
    - Bugs fixed
      - Fixed bug preventing persistent connections reuse when an entity is
        present. Reported by John Logsdon.
      - Fixed potential issue with double consumption of SIP ACK messages. 
        Reported by John Logsdon.
      - Fixed issue with asynchronous responses and provisional responses
        preventing the resue of persistent connections. 
        Reported by Phil Dunks.
      - Fixed NIO connector (HTTP and SIP) bug potentially causing infinite
        loops. Reported by John Logsdon and Phil Dunks.
      - Fixed SIP methods INFO, SUBSCRIBE and SUBSCRIBE to allow responses.
        Reported by Phil Dunks.
      - Fixed NIO connector regression potentially blocking a connection if 
        all the entity couldn't be read from the socket in one shot.
      - Fixed Directory bug when handling conditional requests.
    - Misc
      - If the Engine#logFormatter is set to null, the log formatter of the
        console is not changed anymore.
      - Updated Jackson library to version 1.7.1.
      - Added an "org.restlet.engine.helper" attribute to expose the internal
        helper instance used by a Client or Server instance. Could be 
        leveraged in advanced cases for instrumentation purpose for example.
        Suggested by John Logsdon.
      - Updated Jetty library to version 7.3.0.
      - Updated GWT library to version 2.2.0.
      
- 2.1 Milestone 2 (12/24/2010)
    - API changes
      - The org.restlet.service.TaskService is now a ScheduledExecutorService
        capable of running delayed commands at fixed intervals for example.
        Suggested by Kristoffer Gronowski.
      - JsonRepresentation(Map<Object,Object>) signature changed to the more
        precise JsonRepresentation(Map<String, Object) one.
        Suggested by Tim Peierls.
      - Facilitating the creation of ClientResource subclasses by changing
        the visibility of handle(...) methods from private to protected.
        Leveraged by the SipClientResource in the SIP extension.
        Reported by Phil Dunks.
    - Enhancements
      - Added Request#loggable property, LogService#isLoggable(Request)
        method and LogService#loggableTemplate to enable selective request 
        logging. Suggested by John Logsdon.
      - Added setters with String parameters in addition to Text ones to
        the Feed and Entry classes.
      - Added an EncoderService to automatically compress sent entities
        on both client and server side. Disabled by default on Application.
      - Added UniformResource#requestCacheDirectives and 
        responseCacheDirectives properties.
      - Added UniformResource#doError(Status) and doError(Status, msg)
        methods to allow interception and customization of the default
        behavior (such as throwing a ResourceException on the client-side).
        Suggested by Florian Bucklers.
      - Added a new SIP extension providing support for the Session 
        Initiation Protocol, largely used for voice over IP. This new
        extension ships both client and server SIP connectors over TCP,
        reusing the 90% of the logic used by the new NIO/HTTP internal
        connector, providing excellent scalability and performance.
      - Simplified the default console logging by replacing Java's default
        verbose log formatter by a single line formatter. This formatter
        can be modified via the static Engine#logFormatter property.
      - Added easy programmatic control of log configuration via 
        Engine#logLevel and restletLogLevel static properties.
        If regular log configuration is used via system properties, it 
        is taking over for backward compatibility.
      - In addition to java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter, two new ones are
        added: org.restlet.engine.log.SimplerFormatter and the new default
        org.restlet.engine.log.SimplestFormatter.
      - Removed TraceHandler class, replaced by configurable ConsoleHander
        formatters.
      - Improved the precision of log messages, for example giving the list
        of template variables matched and their value. 
        Suggested by John Logsdon.
      - Optimized routing when 0 characters are matched on an URI template.
      - Added IoUtils.TIMEOUT_MS constant to globally configure I/O related
        timeouts. Its value is 60 seconds by default, but can be configured
        via the "org.restlet.engine.io.timeoutMs" system property. 
      - Added server-side support for Amazon Web Services (S3) authentication.
        Contributed by Jean-Philippe Steinmetz.
      - Added support for DecoderService on the client-side as well.
      - Implemented the automatic filtering of outbound services, via the
        Application#outboundRoot property.
      - Added ConfidentialAuthorizer to limit access to resource to secure
        protocols such as HTTPS.
    - Bugs fixed
      - Fixed writing of big representations. Reported by Tom Andersson. 
      - Fixed IoUtils.BUFFER_SIZE constant to be properly configurable via
        the "org.restlet.engine.io.bufferSize" system property. 
        Reported by Tom Andersson.
      - Fixed auto-detection of XStream annotations. 
        Contributed by Bruno Grieder.
    - Misc
      - Moved UniformResource#doCatch() logic down to ServerResource as it
        was specific to server-side and kept a simpler log trace.
      - Made TCP socket reuse active by default on internal connector.
        Reported by John Logsdon.
      - Lowered log traces for Directory. Suggested by Rickard Oberg.       
      - Moved exception to status conversion logic from UniformResource and
        ServerResource doCatch() methods to the StatusService.
        Suggested by Rhett Sutphin.

- 2.1 Milestone 1 (11/07/2010)
    - API changes
      - Removed deprecated classes and code.
      - The Route class has been reintroduced with a lighter
        behavior not depending on URI templates.
      - Added an UniformResource#setApplication() setter to be able
        to explicitly set the parent application used to pick up the
        ConverterService or MetadataService. This property is also 
        carried on by the copy constructor. Suggested by John Logsdon.
      - Added UniformResource#toString() for easier debugging.
      - Added Representation#isSelectable() and getRegistration() method
        to manipulate the registration of the NIO channel with its 
        associated selector and received asynchronous notifications
        of available content.
      - Deprecated Application#setClientRoot, renamed into a 
        setOutboundRoot method.
    - Enhancements
      - Improved the naming of files created by the FILE local 
        connector so that media type extension comes at the end.
      - Added a fully new non-blocking NIO/HTTP connector in the engine, 
        in replacement of the previous one based on blocking BIO. 
        It has much better performance (latency, throughput and 
        scalability) and supports persistent connections and chunked
        encoding.
    - Misc
      - Removed the Grizzly and Netty extensions which were still 
        considered experimental at this point. The new internal
        connector based on non-blocking NIO now provides similar
        advantages and is already more complete from a HTTP coverage
        point of view. Users of these connectors are encouraged to
        leverage the NIO internal connector or the two other extensions
        that are still available in 2.1 (Jetty and Simple connectors).
      - Added library GWT 2.1.0, removed support of GWT 2.0.
