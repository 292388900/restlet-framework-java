- 2.2 Milestone 2 (02/28/2013)
    - Enhancements
       - Upgraded Servlet API to version 3.0.1.
       - Updated Simple HTTP server library to version 5.0.4.
       - Added a JSONP filter that can automatically wrap JSON representations.
         Contributed by Mark Kharitonov and Cyril Lakech.
    - API changes
       - Refactored the OAuth extension to prevent the 
         org.restlet.ext.oauth.security subpackage.
       - Refactored the JacksonRepresentation to merge the 
         JacksonSmileRepresentation back into the 
         JacksonRepresentation. Also improved extensibility
         and default behavior of the CSV serialization format.
       - Added Request/Response.flushBuffers() method to attempt
         to force network buffers to be flushed out.
         Suggested by Yan Pujante.
       - Removed all code deprecated in branch 2.1.
       - Added patch-related methods to the ConverterService:
         applyPatch(Representation original, Representation patch) : Representation
         revertPatch(Representation modified, Representation patch) : Representation
         createPatch(Representation original, Representation modified) : Representation
       - Added patch(..) methods to ClientResource. Suggested by Brian Sletten.
       - Added patch(..) to ServerResource relying by default on the 
         ConverterService and on the put(..) methods. Suggested by Brian Sletten.
       - Added ClientInfo.acceptedPatches property and HTTP header writing/reading
         logic for "Accept-Patch".
       - Added IOException declaration to all the ConverterService methods.
       - Restored Role.equals(..) and hashCode(..) methods so that two roles with the
         same parent application, name and child roles are equals.
       - Added Role.application property to make it more explicit what is required
         for role equality and to make the MemoryRealm class less ambiguous.
         Reported by Tim Peierls, Martin Svensson, Peter Ansell and others.
       - Deprecated Role.ALL constant which wasn't compatible with the fact that 
         roles have specific applications as parent.
       - Deprecated constructors Role(String) and Role(String, String) and added 
         Role(Application, String) and Role(Application, String, String) as 
         replacements, using Application.getCurrent() to workaround the lack of 
         Application parameter in deprecated constructors.
       - Added findRoles/map/unmap methods with an Application argument to the
         MemoryRealm class for conveniency.
       - Added static get(...) methods to Role.
       - Added getRole(String) method to ServerResource.
       - Refactored GaeEnroler constructors to require proper Role instances or 
         parent Application.
       - Added Component.taskService property and deprecated+disabled the 
         Application.taskService. The same task service/thread pool can then be shared 
         by multiple applications inside the same component/JVM.
       - Added Context.executorService property to be able to invoke the parent task
         service without actually being able to control it (start/stop).
       - Added JaxRsApplication(Context, Application) constructor.
    - Bug fixed
       - The same ones as in version 2.1.2.
    - Misc
       - Updated the links to the user guide in the wiki.

       - Added OBAP (OSGi Bundle Access Protocol) client connector
         to allow access to resources from other OSGi bundles.
         Use "obap://{bundleSymbolicName}/{pathToResource}"

         Suggested by Tim Peierls.

    - Misc
       - Updated Eclipse projects to use JavaSE 6.0 and simple Java 
         build rather than PDE/OSGi (removed manifest.mf files) or 
         Maven (removed pom.xml files).
       - Of course, Maven is still supported via our Maven repository,
         the previous change is only for Restlet committers.
