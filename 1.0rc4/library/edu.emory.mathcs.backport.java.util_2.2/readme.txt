backport-util-concurrent
------------------------

"This package is the backport of java.util.concurrent API, introduced in Java 
5.0 and further refined in Java 6.0, to older Java platforms. The backport is 
based on public-domain sources from the JSR 166 CVS repository, the 
dl.util.concurrent package, and the Doug Lea's collections package.

The ambition of this project is to provide a concurrency library that works 
with uncompromised performance on all Java platforms currently in use, allowing
development of fully portable concurrent applications. OK, let's get real - 
the traget scope is Java 1.3 and above, and some limited 1.2."
